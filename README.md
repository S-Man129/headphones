Implementing a headphone webpage from scratch

0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file



Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
links hover/active: #FF6565
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

1. Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here an archive of all assets needed: images_.zip

Repo:

GitHub repository: headphones
File: 0-index.html, 0-styles.css

3. "What we do..." section
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

GitHub repository: headphones
File: 1-index.html, 1-styles.css


3.  "Our results" section
Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

Repo:

GitHub repository: headphones
File: 2-index.html, 2-styles.css

4.  Contact us
Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

GitHub repository: headphones
File: 3-index.html, 3-styles.css

5.  Footer
Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:

And you are done!

Good job!
